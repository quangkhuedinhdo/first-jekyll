<p class="intro">
Base.vn is a technology platform that offers comprehensive enterprise management software solutions in Vietnam. Its main products include Base Wework, Base Workflow, Base Request, Base E-hiring, Base HRM, Base Timeoff, and Base Expense. These solutions are designed to optimize operational processes and enhance work efficiency across various industries and business sizes. I love these kinds of management solutions. However, their website has some areas that need improvement. We could create a better website so that it works as well as their products.

<h2 class="headline">What can we do now?</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  I learned that the old website has duplicate sections for the content. Hence, I re-constructed it to make it better. We will have a shorter but more compact website. I have noted down the new content structure below.

  With this redesign project, I want to achieve three goals:
(1) A more logical content structure and design
(2) Modern and easily recognizable visuals
(3) Higher information density.
